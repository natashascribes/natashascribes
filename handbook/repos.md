# Repos

When creating new repos or getting access from product teams, please ensure that all writers have access to following areas:
- **GIT Repos:** Provide access to GIT User Codex Writers `@codex-writers` 
- **Publishing setup:** provide access to https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/teamdocs/products/#/ -> *product area*

This is to ensure that:
- we are able to troubleshoot and help each easily
- provide the necessary back up when required
