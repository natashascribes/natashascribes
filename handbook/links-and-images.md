## Link text

- Use your discretion. It is OK to link a full sentence, but avoid longer.

**Correct:**

- For more information, refer to [Annex: Github Flow Details]().

**Incorrect:**

- For an introduction to github, please click [here]().

- Developers can search and download these opportunities [here]().
