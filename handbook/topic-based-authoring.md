# Why topic-based authoring is important for technical writers?

## What is a Topic?

Before we discuss the importance of topic-based authoring, let us look at what is a topic. A topic is a distinct piece of content that has a specific purpose, focuses on one subject, issue, or point and does not require additional information to understand. This smallest unit of information is complete in itself but when combined with other similar units of information, make the help complete.

>These topics can be authored independently and reused or organized as needed.

Topic-based authoring is a scalable and flexible approach to content creation. In this modular approach, content can be arranged or organized by reusing the topics in different context. The Darwin Information Typing Architecture is a standard followed by authors to create topic-based content structured content.

## Types of topics

>**Concept**  – Answers questions like what is this?

These topics contain descriptive information on what, why, and about for a feature or a task. These provides context that helps users to understand the background of a feature or a task. For example, the “About Gmail” topic can include conceptual information on what is Gmail, what are its features, and why is it helpful or should be used.

>**Task** – Answers questions like how do I do this?

These topics contain steps that explains a process or how to perform a task or procedure. For example, the “How to open a Gmail account” topic can explain the steps to open a Gmail account.

>**Reference** – Answers questions like do I need to know anything else?

These topics contain any supportive information or additional details and facts. Generally Reference topics use tables. For example, the “Google Account form fields” can include a table to explain all fields on the “Create your Google Account” form.

## Benefits of topic-based authoring

>Content Reuse

Content can be reused (or single-sourced) to create multiple deliverables for different audience (based on experience or internal vs external content). For example, product overview, user guide, online help can use same conceptual topics. Instead of writing them multiple times, just pull the same topic for different deliverables.

>Easier Collaboration and Maintenance

Multiple writers can work simultaneously on a deliverable by working on one topic at a time. Reusing content means that you update a topic once and latest information is visible everywhere you have used the topic. Since it’s a single topic, it’s easy to update and doesn’t need to written multiple times.

>Consistent Content

Writers can focus on content rather than thinking about look and feel, which is simply governed by different aspects of the structuring the content or CSS. Writers to focus on content and not worry about layout or consistency or structure.

>Reduced translation cost

You can translate topic-by-topic rather than waiting for entire document to be ready. Since the content is reusable, the translation and localization time and cost are reduced significantly.
