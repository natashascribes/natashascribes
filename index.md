# BEING NATASHA
I am a technical content strategist and writer, authoring technical guides on enterprise products. Working alongside developers, designers, product managers, I support and guide the writing team to ensure that product is complemented with engaging web-based technical content of the highest quality.  

When not writing technical content, you’ll find me running, working out at gym, writing under the stars, or watching marvel movies with my son. Though I am full time technical writer by profession, I occasionally write about my travel, life, fitness, and my son. Read more about my personal journey here: https://medium.com/natashascribes
