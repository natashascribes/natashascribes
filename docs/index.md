# Technical Writing Handbook

## Being a Technical Writer
As a technical writer, you are responsible for providing detailed instructions and conceptual information on a specific product. You will help the user understand what the product is, why you need the product or what problems the product can resolve for you, and how the product works.

As a technical writer, you need to understand the product and the user for whom you are writing. This means that you not only have to keep learning new products but also understand each feature that you are documenting while considering how your user will use the information. Since you need to write about the technical product in simple and straightforward terms, you must be well-versed with the product.

## Fundamentals

Some of the fundamentals for being a good technical writer are:

**Audience analysis** 

Know your users. Write based on your user’s context. For example, ask yourself if your user is experienced or novice or somewhere in between. Do not assume a user would know the concepts. Someone who comes to documentation would have either tried everything in the product or might be new to the product and is looking to get started. As a writer, you want to cover content to help them.

**Adapt your writing**

When writing, think of user experience and adapt your writing to match your audience requirements. Think how they will search for information, or navigate through the doc. Will they go based on a workflow? Or will alphabetical order be a better approach? When developing content, take some time to go over the overall flow and think like a user. You want to write a document that is useful as usable by your users/readers and not just comprehensive. Having all the information in the world will not help if the information does not provide what your users need.

**Use proper English**

You must be able to explain not just steps but concepts on features in simple and clear English. Do remember that the content might be translated to other languages. You are not just writing for English speakers but also for non-English speakers. When incorrect English is entered into translation tools, the meaning might change altogether. 

**Write simple**

You are writing to help users understand the product and not showcase your vocabulary. If you can use simple English to convey, use simple words. The only exception would be to use an industry-wide technical term to explain a product.

**Learn the product**

Use the product to understand what it does and how it works. If you do not understand the product, you will most likely just write what the developer is saying. If the developer were able to explain the product, why would we need writers to break it down into simple language? The developers are technical experts and know what they are talking about but our users might not have the same technical skills or be well-versed with the technical language that the developers use. Therefore, learn the product to use, and then write about it.

## Why do you need a technial writer?

Most of the organizations start with developing a product. When they try to release their product in the market, they realize that customers are looking for documentation supporting their product. What happens next is that developers who built the product are asked to write about it. However, since the developers are technical people and not professional communicators or writers, the document that we get from them is also technical and probably full of developer terms. A technical document with jargons or internal terms, may or may not help the customers. That’s where the technical writers are introduced. There are organizations, however, who realize this requirement much sooner than the release stage and engage with the writer as soon as the development kicks off.

Let us look at some of the benefits of hiring a technical writer:

**Describe features clearly**

A technical writer has the ability to understand technical aspects and convert the technical information into simple to understand concepts, procedures, and reference content. All this with customer journey and usability of the doc as the base. A technical writer uses the product to write it to ensure they understand what they are writing to be able to simplify it.

**Reduce support and training cost**

Providing a detailed document on the product and its features, along with how to use them will get the customers started rather than having them call the support or asking for free training to learn the product. Remember technical writers do not just produce written content but tutorials, knowledge base articles, video content, etc. as well. All this helps onboard customers faster and reduce the support cases, reducing the support and training costs.

**Reduce documentation cost**

Engaging a technical writer from the beginning will reduce your documentation cost as you will have a dedicated professional working with your developers from the beginning to define the content strategy, plan the content, and get the content out the door along with your product. You would also have saved the developer bandwidth by not asking them to write the documents. 

**Sell the product**

Yes, sounds strange but this is true. This is the baseline for selling a product. Even a 2$ razor comes with a basic documentation or microcopy. This is a plain fact that each product to be sold has to accompany documentation. In addition, a technical writer can explain the concept of a product, benefits of using the product, and problems the product will solve in a very simple language, create videos to convey the same information, and provide you with better sales oriented power points to help with sales.

**Deliver customer experience** 

A technical writer always writes based on how the customer will experience the product or use the document. Due to this customer focused thought process, a technical writer tries to simplify complex topics and continuously works towards improving the content quality as well as usability of the documents. 

To summarize, technical writers help build a strong foundation of the product team by asking questions that your customer might ask later. So, it is a wise investment to invest in a technical writer for the detailed eye and a customer advocate built into your team.

## Skills Beyond Technical Writing

Technical writer role primarily requires you to have writing skills to document a product or a service. However, to be a successful technical writer and grow in the field, you are required to have few additional skills. Let us look at some of these skills and how you can develop to be productive and successful as a technical writer.

**XML**

Almost all the authoring tools use xml-based authoring. Authoring in XML enables you to focus on writing by separating the formatting from the content. In addition, XML supports all forms of output – PDF, Web Help, HTML web page, EPUB, or other document types. Since most of the writers are expected to understand end-to-end flow of writing, you will need to learn how to work with an XML editor and how to publish XML documents to other document types.

**Business**

Learn the business. An easy way to stay involved is to attend all hands. THese meetings are useful to get a 360 degree view of organizational strategy. Know how you are or can add value to the business. The all hands and town hall meetings provide insights on the direction an organization is taking to meet the company goals. Knowing these organizational goals will help you understand where you can add value – either through documentation or other additional initiatives. 

**Customer Experience**

Customer experience is at the top of any organization’s strategy and goal. An important aspect to consider is that customer experience is not only delivered through software products but also through documentation. Documentation is also a product or a service that you are providing along with the software product. Understanding this aspect and working towards improving customer experience through content solutions will help you stand out. 

**Project Management**

As a technical writer, you are often responsible for managing more than one project. Developing good project management skills will help you plan and keep up with your deliveries. This skill clubbed with time management will ensure that you do not block the sprint delivery or worse end up holding the release of a new product. 

**Audience Analysis**

You need to know who you are writing for. Knowing how the customer would use the product will help you create a logical flow of documentation and write better instructions with all the necessary tips and guidance to make this a smooth journey for the customer.

To be an effective and productive technical writer, you need to cultivate additional skills that may or may not be included in the job description but are essential part of your job. These skills need to be developed to be efficient at your job as well as grow in your field.
