  <summary>2. While onboarding to Microsoft Endpoint Manager, I get an error message, <em>"Could not download the identity profile from the Encrypted Profile Service. The credentials within the Device Enrolment profile may have expired."</em></summary>

  One of the possible reasons could be that your device was earlier onboarded by another user in Microsoft Endpoint Manager and was not offboarded properly.  

  To confirm if that is the case, contact the [SEED team](mailto:gcc2.0_support@tech.gov.sg)  with your device serial number. The SEED team can verify if your device was previously enrolled in Microsoft Endpoint Manager under a different user. If this is confirmed, offboard it properly before proceeding to onboard again.

  5. Why does my device slowdown after onboarding to Microsoft Endpoint Manager?</summary>

  SEED is designed to use **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to ensure device is free from malware, prevent and respond to advanced threats. If there is any other antivirus or anti-malware running simultaneously, it could compromise the operating system's performance. To resolve this, disable or uninstall antivirus other than **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.

  8. Why am I prompted to turn on my system integrity protection?
  </summary>

  It is a policy requirement by the SEED team. System Integrity Protection is a security technology in OS X El Capitan and later that's designed to help prevent potentially malicious software from modifying protected files and folders on your macOS. System Integrity Protection restricts the root user account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of the macOS.
