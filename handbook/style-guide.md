## Headings
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/headings 

Think of headings as an outline, only more interesting—pithy, even. If readers don't read the headings, they probably won't read the text that follows, either.

Top-level headings communicate what's most important and divide content into major subjects. Make them as specific as you can to catch the reader's attention.

When there's a lot to say under a top-level heading, look for two or more distinct topics, and use second-level headings (subheads) to break up the large section into more scannable chunks. If you can't find at least two distinct topics, skip the second-level headings.

Avoid having two headings in a row without text in between—that might indicate a problem with organization or that the headings are redundant. But don't insert filler text just to separate the headings.

Each new heading represents a new or more specific topic. The heading should introduce the topic in an interesting way.

Use headings judiciously. One heading level is usually plenty for a page or two of content. For long content, you might need to use additional heading levels. For example, this guide uses four heading levels.

Keep headings as short as possible, and put the most important idea at the beginning. This is especially critical in blogs and social media.

Be as specific as you can, and be even more detailed with lower-level headings. For example, a second-level heading should be more specific than a first-level heading.

Focus on what matters to customers, and choose words they'd use themselves. In most cases, don't talk about products, features, or commands in headings. Concentrate on what customers can achieve or what they need to know.

Use parallel sentence structure for all headings at the same level. For example, use noun phrases for first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level headings, and infinitive phrases for headings in instructions.  
**Examples**  

```
# Source data

## Prepare headings

### To create a heading

## Scrub data

### To remove blank rows

# PivotTable reports

# Report filters

```

Consider infinitive phrases, such as To create a heading, for headings and titles related to tasks. For headings that aren't related to tasks, use a noun phrase such as Headings, if possible.

Don’t use ampersands (&) or plus signs (+) in headings unless you're referring to UI that contains them or space is limited.

Avoid hyphens in headings if you can. In resized windows or mobile devices, they can result in awkward line breaks.

Use vs., not v. or versus, in headings.
