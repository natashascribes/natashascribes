# Case Study Template

Just to be sure that we want to write Case Study and not Whitepaper, please read these points:
- A white paper provides the benefits and rationale for the implementation of a proposed solution, while a case study provides actual examples for how a solution has fixed a problem.
- A case study typically offers greater detail than a white paper, with the exception of technical white papers.
- Case studies focus more on examination and proving a solution’s effectiveness, while white papers do not provide this evidence.
- Case study includes following elements:
  - Showcase the problem that you solved
  - Share customer's experience
  - Results/outcomes


This section includes two templates:
- [Basic](#basic-case-study-template)
- [Detailed](#detailed-case-study-template)
