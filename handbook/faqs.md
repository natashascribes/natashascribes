  One of the possible reasons could be that your device was earlier onboarded by another user in Microsoft Endpoint Manager and was not offboarded properly.  

  To confirm if that is the case, contact the [SEED team](mailto:gcc2.0_support@tech.gov.sg)  with your device serial number. The SEED team can verify if your device was previously enrolled in Microsoft Endpoint Manager under a different user. If this is confirmed, offboard it properly before proceeding to onboard again.

  SEED is designed to use **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to ensure device is free from malware, prevent and respond to advanced threats. If there is any other antivirus or anti-malware running simultaneously, it could compromise the operating system's performance. To resolve this, disable or uninstall antivirus other than **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.
